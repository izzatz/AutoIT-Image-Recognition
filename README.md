# AutoIT-Image-Recognition
Image recognition on desktop

This is a standard library that I got from https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/148005-imagesearch-usage-explanation/page/3/#comments
There is a bunch of 3rd party libraries, and it is not an official port from AutoIT. 
The one I uploaded in this GitHub is the one I tested working and it is for my personal usage.
